# NWO_LaTeX_Template
LaTeX template for NWO's format for Veni/Vidi/Vici proposals

For anyone interested in using a LaTeX template instead of a Word template for writing their grant applications to NWO, 
my own template is now available. I recommend adapting the LaTeX template to ensure it matches the Word template provided 
by NWO for your current grant application. I adapted the template by Mark van der Sluys, resulting in a new and updated 
version of the template.  The template is compiled by the main file: NWO_template.tex. The other source files are the six 
sections of the template that serve as input to the main file, the bibliography (a BiBTeX file), and a class file containing 
all the layout specifications. I added comments in the LaTeX documents to explain the details. Please make sure to check 
the .cls file as the file requires a few changes to personalize your template (e.g. add your name to the authornamebold 
command, change the scheme and year to match your specific grant application, etc.).
